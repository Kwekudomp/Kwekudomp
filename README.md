## 💭 Research Philosophy

I believe the most impactful operations research emerges at the intersection of rigorous theory and practical implementation. My work demonstrates that:
- **Real-world problems** drive interesting theoretical questions
- **Commercial validation** provides evidence of research impact beyond academic metrics
- **Production systems** require both algorithmic sophistication and pragmatic engineering
- **Interdisciplinary approaches** combining ML, OR, and software engineering unlock new possibilities

The gap between theoretical optimization and deployed systems remains wide in many domains. My goal is to contribute research that advances both theoretical understanding and practical capability, creating algorithms and systems that perform reliably in real-world conditions with uncertain data, human factors, and operational constraints.

## 🌟 Personal Philosophy

*"Never too late!"* - I believe in continuous learning, practical application of theory, and using technology to solve meaningful problems. Whether through academic research or commercial solutions, I'm driven to make complex systems work better for the people who depend on them.

The journey from business school to operations research has been unconventional, but my diverse background in finance, analytics, and software engineering uniquely positions me to tackle complex optimization problems with both theoretical rigor and practical sensibility.
